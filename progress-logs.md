# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 008: June 23, 2020:

**Today's Progress:**
- For the first mini-project I will be working on song genre classification. Started reading about it online. 

**Thoughts:**
I found application of ML/DL in audio domain to be quite interesting, deviated from the main topic a bit and read about more of it's applications.


### Day 007: June 22, 2020:

**Today's Progress:** 
- Leetcode: [137. Single Number II](https://leetcode.com/problems/single-number-ii/)
- Leetcode: [70. Climbing Stairs](https://leetcode.com/problems/climbing-stairs/)

**Thoughts:** 
Both were really fun problems, especially the first one, had to struggle a bit to come up with the bit manipulation solution.


### Day 006: June 21, 2020:

**Today's Progress:** 
- Finished Chapter 3 of Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow, 2nd Edition.

**Thoughts:**
This was a good refresher about classification in general and helped strengthen my understanding of some of the basics.


### Day 005: June 20, 2020:

**Today's Progress:**
- Started with Chapter 3 of Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow, 2nd Edition.

**Thoughts:** Was a bit boring as the topic was about MNIST digit classification again.


### Day 004: June 19, 2020:

**Today's Progress:**
- Finished Chapter 2 of Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow, 2nd Edition.

**Thoughts:** Finally some noticable progress.


### Day 003: June 18, 2020:

**Today's Progress:**
- Leetcode: [700. Search in a Binary Search Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/search-in-a-binary-search-tree/)
- Leetcode: [119. Pascal's Triangle II](https://leetcode.com/problems/search-in-a-binary-search-tree/)
- Leetcode: [509. Fibonacci Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/fibonacci-number/)

**Thoughts:** Felt a bit lazy today, so just worked on Leetcode Recursion-I, have to finish this section in 2 more days. 


### Day 002: June 17, 2020:

**Today's Progress:**
- Read through ImageNet and AlexNet papers again but in detail. (Will try to implement the Alexnet in the coming days.)
- Continued Chapter 2 of Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow, 2nd Edition and played around with California Housing Prices dataset.
- Leetcode: [206. Reverse Linked List](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-linked-list/)

**Thoughts:** Gained some confidence in reading research papers. Still need to work on how I approach solving recursive problems. 


### Day 001: June 16, 2020:

**Today's Progress:**
- Read (Single pass) ImageNet and AlexNet papers.
- Leetcode: [24. Swap Nodes in Pairs](https://leetcode.com/problems/swap-nodes-in-pairs/).

**Thoughts:** Reading research papers is fun. Had a better understanding of ImageNet and AlexNet.


### Day 000: June 15, 2020:

**Today's Progress:**
 - Read the article: [A few useful things to know about ML](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~pedrod/papers/cacm12.pdf)
 - Started [Recursion - I](https://leetcode.com/explore/learn/card/recursion-i/250/principle-of-recursion/) in Leetcode Explore section and solved [344. Reverse String](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-string/)
 - Started with Chapter 2 of Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow, 2nd Edition.

**Thoughts:** Feel highly motivated, started a study group in slack to discuss ML related topics and keep track of progress. The article was simple to go through but had good information on basic Machine Learning principles.
