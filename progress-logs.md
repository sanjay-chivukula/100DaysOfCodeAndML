# 100 Days Of Code - Log


### Day 0: June 15, 2020:

**Today's Progress**:
 - Read the article: [A few useful things to know about ML](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~pedrod/papers/cacm12.pdf)
 - Started [Recursion - I](https://leetcode.com/explore/learn/card/recursion-i/250/principle-of-recursion/) in Leetcode Explore section and solved [344. Reverse String](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-string/)
 - Started with Chapter 2 of Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow, 2nd Edition.

**Thoughts:** Feel highly motivated, started a study group in slack to discuss ML related topics and keep track of progress. The article was simple to go through but had good information on basic Machine Learning principles.
