# 100DaysOfCode
This group will be working on ML/DL related concepts primarily for the challenge. 
We will be covering topics in breath majorly and diving deeper into some (bottom-up learning). 
We will also get our hands dirty by diving into mini-projects (top-down learning).

## Goal:
 - Read: Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow, 2nd Edition (Minimum) (we can discuss and change this as it is not a free book)
 - Read Research Papers: 1 each week (Minimum)
 - Mini Projects: 1 each week (Following tutorials, kaggle, blogs, self)

## TODO(15(US)/16(IND) June, 2020 (Mon)):
 - Everyone create a repository for 100daysofcode in their github or fork the template repo from [100daysofcode official log template repo](https://github.com/Kallaway/100-days-of-code).
 - Create a twitter account if you don't have. 
 - Share repository link so that we can keep track of others progress, also try to follow the rules in the template repo (about sharing progress on twitter etc). 
 - Get your basic work environment setup (discuss with the group if you need any help for this.)
 - Lets have a short discussion later today on what people are comfortable with doing and how much time they can afford each day on an average.


# Materials
You can find links to learn and explore ML by following the links below.
**Python basics:**
  - [Python FreeCodeCamp](https://www-freecodecamp-org.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/www.freecodecamp.org/news/the-ultimate-guide-to-python-from-beginner-to-intermediate-to-pro/amp/#)
  - [Automate Boring Stuff with Python](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/)
**ML Materials:**
  - [I strongly recommend this link](https://machinelearningmastery.com/start-here/#getstarted)
**ML Papers:**  
It your choice if you want to read papers, though I strongly recommend to cultivate the habit of going through research papers. It is ok if you don't understand things in the first read, and you can always discuss or search online about them.
  - [Weekly ML Papers to Read](./ml-papers-todo.md)
**ML Mini-projects:**  
People can pair up for some big projects if they want or if they want general team project experience.
