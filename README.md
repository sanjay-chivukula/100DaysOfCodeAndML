# #100DaysOfCodeAndML
I will be working on ML/DL/CV related concepts primarily for the challenge. 
I will be covering topics in breath majorly and diving deeper into some (bottom-up learning). 
I will also get my hands dirty by diving into mini-projects (top-down learning).
Apart from these I will also work on some software principles like design patterns, creating mini-games, simple web applications, solving problems on leet-code.

## Goal:
 - Read: Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow, 2nd Edition (Minimum)
 - Read Research Papers: 1 each week (Minimum). [Research Papers](./research-papers-todo.md)
 - Mini Projects: 1 each week (Following tutorials, kaggle, blogs, self). [Mini Projects](./mini-projects-todo.md)
 - General software concepts (will not be primary focus.)
 
## Progress Logs:
My everyday updates related to this challenge can be found here: [Progress Logs](./progress-logs.md)
 
## Rules:
 - I will go through my topics which are in the goals section each day and update my progress in the logs.
 - I will also update anything related to programming and software development that I worked on or learnt that day in the logs.
